# Instructional Bug-Report

If you have any uncertainty/difficulty then ask any dev for help on how to do it — we'll love to help as good bug reports are 🏆

> We strive to check and verify new bug reports daily. If it's very critical to get an immediate fix then do an `@wiefunkdai` on `#ErrorRespositoryName` with link to the bug report you've just created.
